1. Factors 
        1. example n = 100
            step 1 - underroote 100 = 10 
            step 2 - 1 to 10 the factors are 1,2,4,5,10
            step 3 - divide by the 100/factor to get the higher factors 


[a,b] - number of elements are b-a+1
[a,b) - number of elements are b-a
(a,b] - number of elements are b-a
(a,b) - number of elemets are b-a-1 ( b>a)
[a,b] if we are moving from a to b as hops ( fixed value of jumps) - 1+ [b-a/c(jumps)]


Iteration 
1. break - do not count the later loops 
2. continue - count that loop
