1407. Top Travellers

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name, ifnull(sum(distance),0) as travelled_distance 
from Users left join Rides on Users.id = Rides.user_id
group by Users.id
order by travelled_distance desc, name asc

Issues:
  1. Made a mistake in calling the ifnull 
  2. Handling Duplicate names ( Group by id)
