1303. Find the Team Size

SELECT e.employee_id, t.team_size
FROM Employee e
JOIN (
    SELECT team_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS team_size
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY team_id
) t ON e.team_id = t.team_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id;


Observation:
    1. Use your logic (COUNT with GROUP BY employee_id) when you need to count how many rows or occurrences exist for each employee directly. For example: "How many times does each employee appear in the table?"

    2. Use the corrected logic (GROUP BY team_id and JOIN) when you need to count something at a group level (like team size) and associate that back to the individual employees. For example: "How many people are in each employee's team?"
