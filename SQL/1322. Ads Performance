Learning:
  1. Multiple CTEs: You cannot have multiple WITH clauses like that. Instead, you should combine them into a single WITH clause by using multiple CTE definitions separated by commas.

  2. Invalid Condition in WHERE Clause: In the WHERE clause, action is 'Clicked' and action is 'Viewed' are incorrect. Instead, you should use action = 'Clicked' and action = 'Viewed'.

  3. Missing Joins: The cte CTEs are not being joined with each other, which means they will not be able to combine data from the different actions.

  4. Query Logic: You should use SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) to properly sum the clicks and views.
